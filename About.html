			<h3>About Evans</h3>
			<hr />
			
			<p>I was born and bred in GaMalaka, a village in the mountains of 
		   Sekhukhune in Limpopo. I'm the first born of five(5) kids of Mr MJ and Mrs MS Tjabadi. I completed my junior education at Sedikwe Primary and my 
		   seconday education at Matshumane Secondary. I joined Kutlwanong programme(A centre for maths, science and technology-Weekend extra classes) in 
		   2013 mid year. 
		   
			</p>
			<p>
			In my matric year 2015, I was required to be within a school premises 7 days a week. I barely differentiated a new week day(monday) from the rest.
			My perserverance finally paid off come the year end. 26th position in the Limpopo provinve on average, 3rd in the Sekhukhune district and 1st im my school and also 1st
			in our Kutlwanong/Promaths centre. I also obtained 100% in physical sciences coming out (one of) the top in the province, my school and also my Kutlwanong/Promaths centre.
			<br /> <br/>
			
			I'm currently registered with the university of Cape Town, studying towards a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. I took some roles in
			2017; Secretary of Kutlwanong/Promaths almuni society, mentor for a floor at our residence, and church small group leadership. My first two years went
			exceptionally well, I came out top in my  1st year 1st semester maths module, and also listed on our Dean's merit list for 2016.<br /> <br />
			
			I attended a two weeks engineering student training at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology at the end of 2017 academic year. It was the (to date)
			practicals closer to the industry/field I ever had. We learnt a few skiils there; CNC, Welding, Robotics, Fitting/Turning and Pnuematics.
			
			
			<h4>Why electrical engineering?</h4>
			I started interfacing with electricity only when I was around 11 years old. It was just after they installed electricity services at our village, 
			being the 1st born in my family with my Dad working miles away from home,  I had to wire the house. At first, all lights were operated with one switch, 
			the I learnt more and improved a little and little. 4 years later, I removed all wires and rewired the house again from scratch, this time with enough knowledge.
			
			<br /> <br />
			When I was in matric, our country experienced a great deal of load shedding. As a physical sciences learner, I had a few ideas running through my mind.
			I then decided to pursue a career in heavy current and green energy generation.
			
			
			
			<br /> <br />
			<h4>Blessings in disguise </h4>
				
			Unfortunely I got a bursary that only caters for light current, but our university degree offers a bit of both light and heavy current. 
			I actually became better with light current modules than heavy current stuff. I'm planing on taking more of light current course as my bursary
			requires. I plan to specialse in process and control engineering, and do a side job(research) on green energy generation.
